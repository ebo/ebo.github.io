### “Have hodad, will travel”

Hello. I am currently working as a Sr. Software Engineer for the joint NASA-NOAA GOES mission helping to maintain the L2 algorithms.

<!-- About me, I like to see the big picture. I live in the world of possibilities and become excited about concepts, challenges, and difficulties.
I love to make new friends, travel and learn about different cultures. I like to read, paint, sketch, and play cricket.
From putting together some cool robots to developing new ways computers can empower the masses -- I am interested in it.
